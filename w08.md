# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Why should we create our own Linux From Scratch?](https://www.quora.com/Why-should-anyone-build-Linux-from-scratch)<br>

	This thread might answer your questions about the purpose of experimenting with linux by building it from the ground up using quotes from the LFS guidebook.<br>

2. [Why do we need CPU scheduling?](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>

	This website gives a brief illustration on the aim and impact of having CPU scheduling.<br>

3. [When is preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling used?](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)<br>

	An overview of this topic can be read on this website. It gives a clear explanation between the key differences among the two types.<br>

4. [The various algorithms for CPU scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>

	Understanding which algorithm to use in which situation will lead to a more optimized scheduling. The algorithm presented in this website is given a good explanation about the whys and hows.<br>

5. [Criteria for CPU scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-criteria/)<br>

	To choose the correct algorithm, you can use the set of criterias as a baseline to benchmark the CPU performance.<br>

6. [Issues in multiprocessor scheduling](https://www.ques10.com/p/46913/issues-in-multiprocessor-scheduling-1/)<br>

	Here are some example of issues that might arise in parallel programming when scheduling on a multiprocessor CPU.<br>

7. [Difference between CPU and I/O burst](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)<br>

	These two concepts apply to two different tasks. One is when an instruction is executed and the other is when fetching data is necessary respectively.<br>
