# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [C Programming Cheatsheet](https://developerinsider.co/c-programming-language-cheat-sheet/)<br>

	A compact and useful guide for C programming.<br>

2. [What are the advantages of coding in C?](https://data-flair.training/blogs/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-c/)<br>

	There are several benefits and downsides of programming with C. In certain cases the compromises are worth more for the overall performance.<br>

3. [What is gcc and make?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/768373/what-is-the-difference-between-make-and-gcc)<br>

	Make is a command to run makefile which is a set of rules that utilizes a compiler to build a project. Gcc is a compiler that is commonly invoked when a makefile is executed using make.<br>

4. [When is a PGP secret key considered compromised?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/154969/is-a-secret-pgp-key-considered-compromised-if-it-reaches-the-net)<br>

	As long as the key availability is shorter than the theoritically feasable time it takes to crack the password it is assumed safe. However, PGP does not offer forward secrecy hence if a previous key was compromised, any data using it can be bruteforced without a time limit.<br>

5. [What is NFS, its components, and its usage](https://medium.com/mtiakakom/network-file-system-nfs-f1a14b7b33e2)<br>

	NFS provides a method to share resources between remote devices to local ones as if it was local itself.<br>

6. [Why linux doesn't need fragmentation and comparison with Windows file system](https://www.howtogeek.com/115229/htg-explains-why-linux-doesnt-need-defragmenting/)<br>

	Linux’s ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems – ext4 being the file system used by Ubuntu and most other current Linux distributions – allocates files in a more intelligent way. Instead of placing multiple files near each other on the hard disk, Linux file systems scatter different files all over the disk, leaving a large amount of free space between them.<br>

7. [Difference between C and C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-c-and-c/)<br>

	While the core syntax remain mostly the same, C++ offer a more extensive library.<br>

8. [What is a linux swap space for?](https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/)<br>

	Swapping is necessary for two important reasons. First, when the system requires more memory than is physically available, the kernel swaps out less used pages and gives memory to the current application (process) that needs the memory immediately. Second, a significant number of the pages used by an application during its startup phase may only be used for initialization and then never used again.<br>

9. [Understanding single level directory](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-single-level-directory)<br>

	It is simply having the entire system on one directory with the advantage being very simple and the disadvantage being there can be no duplicate files and searching would be hard.<br>

10. [Basics of Access Control in Linux](https://devconnected.com/access-control-lists-on-linux-explained/)<br>

	A complete guide for setting up access control lists in linux.<br>
