# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Difference between bash and zsh](https://dev.to/jasmin/a-brief-difference-between-zsh-and-bash-5ebp)<br>

	Both are shells that serve as an interface between the user and the operating system services. Bash were created first (Bourne Shell) and later came Zshell or ZSH that has a few new features such as better autocompletion, performance, and configurations.<br>

2. [What is UEFI and how is it different from BIOS](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/htg-explains-how-uefi-will-replace-the-bios/)<br>

	BIOS is a firmware that serves as the most basic interface layer between the hardware and operating system. UEFI is a newer model of BIOS that is slowly replacing the usage of BIOS in computers.<br>

3. [Processors are pushing up against the limits of physical hardware](https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/08/are-processors-pushing-up-against-the-limits-of-physics/)<br>

	There are physical limitations (such as the smallest possible component is the size of an atom) however we would most likely encounter a softer limit before reaching that deadend which is easier to work around.<br>

4. [Multi-threading and multi-core](https://www.eetimes.com/demystifying-multithreading-and-multi-core/)<br>

	Both aspects exploit concurrency to spread the processing load. The core difference is where that spread happens. Multi-threads are a processor-level optimization to improve area and energy efficiency whereas multi-cores are a system-level technique.<br>

5. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>

	Parallelism is a specific kind of concurrency where tasks are really executed simultaneously. A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously.<br>

6. [Virtual memory in operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>

	The system/program maps memory addresses as virtual addresses and treats it as physical addresses in the computer's main memory.<br>

7. [What is the C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library)<br>

	The C standard library provides macros, type definitions and functions for tasks such as string handling, mathematical computations, input/output processing, memory management, and several other operating system services.<br>

8. [What is an API?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)<br>

	An API is what defines the kind of interactions between softwares/programs such as the kinds of request that can be made, how to make them, and the data format used.<br>

9. [Bash scripting for beginners](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>

	Here is a short tutorial for bash shell script basics.<br>

10. [Process manager in operating system](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/process-management-of-operating-system.aspx)<br>

	Process managers are responsible for the creation of processes, scheduling them, managing deadlocks, and termination of a process.<br>
