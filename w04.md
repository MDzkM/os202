# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Why do we need pointers?](http://duramecho.com/ComputerInformation/WhyCPointers.html)<br>

	I found this interesting explanation about the why and how a pointer is used. It is a quick and easy to understand read that might help you understand C programming better.<br>

2. [Top 20 common pitfalls when using C pointers](https://www.acodersjourney.com/top-20-c-pointer-mistakes/)<br>

	This article is interesting as it lists the most frequent mistakes programmers make when using C pointers. You might also encounter some of these while learning C.<br>

3. [Major problems with pointers](https://www.acodersjourney.com/top-20-c-pointer-mistakes/)<br>

	What I can conclude from this thread is that usually the problem is not the pointer itself but the existance of a wild pointer which is pointing at the wrong value. Pointer is a very powerful tool yet they can be very hard to debug.<br>

4. [Difference between ELF files and binary files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2427011/what-is-the-difference-between-elf-files-and-bin-files)<br>

	This thread explains it clearly the difference of content between those two file formats.<br>

5. [Types of pointers in C](https://tekslate.com/explain-different-types-pointers-c-language)<br>

	A brief guide of the various types of pointers in C.<br>

6. [Best practices for C programming](https://data-flair.training/blogs/c-programming-best-practices/)<br>

	This guide helped me create a clean and more efficient C code. It also alleviates the possibility of bugs occurring.<br>

7. [Dynamic memory allocation in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)<br>

	There are certain situations where memory is either wasted or insufficient, that's why I learnt from this website that for such cases, a function like realloc is important to manage those memory allocations.<br>

8. [Common mistakes when allocating memory](https://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/resources/jmr/alloc-goodbad.html)<br>

	You can read a few examples of bad memory allocation when progamming with C on this webpage.<br>

9. [Understanding shared libraries in linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/)<br>

	From this article I learnt how to locate and manage shared libraries and better understand the different classes of linux libraries.<br>

10. [Basics of C addressing](https://denniskubes.com/2012/08/17/basics-of-memory-addresses-in-c/)<br>

	This blog can be a good intro before diving into pointers in C as it explains the gist of addresses in C.<br>
